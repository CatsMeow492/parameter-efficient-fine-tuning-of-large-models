## Abstract

We present the first systematic study of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) placement strategies in transformer models, investigating whether selective targeting of specific layer types can achieve comparable performance to full-model adaptation while using fewer trainable parameters. Through controlled ablation studies on DialoGPT-medium using the Alpaca dataset, we compare three strategies: baseline LoRA (all modules), attention-only LoRA (c_attn, c_proj), and feed-forward-only LoRA (c_fc). Our key findings reveal that attention layers are more critical than feed-forward layers for adaptation effectiveness, with attention-only achieving only 12.7% performance degradation while reducing parameters by 31.2%. Remarkably, feed-forward-only LoRA achieves 99.45% parameter reduction with 37.7% performance degradation, establishing extreme efficiency for resource-constrained deployments. We also discover unexpected relationships between evaluation loss and perplexity metrics, suggesting important considerations for parameter-efficient fine-tuning evaluation. Our results provide practitioners with quantitative guidelines for selecting LoRA placement strategies based on specific efficiency-performance requirements, establishing the first systematic framework for strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning deployment.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, but their increasing size presents significant challenges for practical deployment. Models like GPT-3 (175B parameters) and PaLM (540B parameters) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but require substantial computational resources for fine-tuning, often exceeding the capacity of many research labs and organizations.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged as crucial solutions to this scalability challenge. Among these, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained particular prominence for its simplicity and effectiveness. LoRA freezes pre-trained model weights and introduces trainable low-rank decomposition matrices, typically reducing trainable parameters by 99% while maintaining competitive performance.

### 1.1 Research Motivation

Despite LoRA's success, a critical question remains unexplored: **Can selective LoRA placement in specific transformer layers achieve comparable performance to full-model LoRA placement while using fewer trainable parameters?** Current implementations typically apply LoRA to all linear projections uniformly, but this approach may be suboptimal for many practical scenarios.

Different transformer components serve distinct computational roles:
- **Attention layers** (c_attn, c_proj) handle token-to-token interactions and contextual relationships
- **Feed-forward layers** (c_fc) perform element-wise transformations and feature mapping

Understanding the relative importance of these components for adaptation could enable more strategic parameter allocation, particularly valuable for:
- **Resource-constrained environments** (mobile devices, edge computing)
- **Multi-task learning scenarios** where parameter budgets must be allocated across tasks
- **Continual learning applications** requiring efficient adaptation to new domains

### 1.2 Research Contributions

This work presents the first systematic investigation of LoRA placement strategies, making several key contributions:

1. **Comprehensive Ablation Study**: We conduct controlled experiments comparing three LoRA placement strategies across identical experimental conditions
2. **Layer Importance Hierarchy**: We establish quantitative evidence that attention layers are more critical than feed-forward layers for adaptation effectiveness
3. **Efficiency-Performance Trade-offs**: We identify optimal strategies for different computational constraints, achieving up to 99.45% parameter reduction
4. **Novel Metric Insights**: We discover unexpected relationships between evaluation loss and perplexity, highlighting important considerations for PEFT evaluation
5. **Practical Guidelines**: We provide evidence-based recommendations for practitioners selecting LoRA placement strategies

### 1.3 Paper Organization

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Section 3 details our experimental methodology, Section 4 presents comprehensive results and analysis, and Section 5 concludes with implications and future directions.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Landscape

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical research area addressing the computational challenges of fine-tuning large language models. While traditional fine-tuning updates all model parameters, PEFT techniques selectively modify small subsets while freezing the majority of weights.

**Adapter-Based Methods**: Houlsby et al. (2019) introduced adapter modules—small neural networks inserted between transformer layers. AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) extends this approach for multi-task scenarios, while AdapterDrop (Rücklé et al., 2021) addresses inference efficiency. These methods typically achieve 0.4-2% of original parameters while maintaining competitive performance.

**Prompt-Based Approaches**: Prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021) optimizes continuous prompt embeddings rather than discrete tokens. Prefix tuning (Li & Liang, 2021) extends this concept to both encoder and decoder layers. P-tuning v2 (Liu et al., 2022) demonstrates that properly designed prompt tuning can match full fine-tuning across various tasks and model scales.

**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Hu et al. (2022) introduced LoRA based on the hypothesis that weight updates during adaptation have low intrinsic dimensionality. By decomposing weight updates into low-rank matrices (W + ΔW = W + BA), LoRA achieves remarkable parameter efficiency, typically using <1% of original parameters while maintaining strong performance across diverse tasks.

### 2.2 LoRA Variants and Extensions

**AdaLoRA** (Zhang et al., 2023) introduces adaptive rank allocation, dynamically adjusting ranks based on importance scores computed during training. This approach achieves better parameter-performance trade-offs by concentrating parameters where they provide maximum benefit.

**QLoRA** (Dettmers et al., 2023) combines LoRA with 4-bit quantization, enabling efficient fine-tuning of 65B parameter models on single GPUs. This work demonstrates that extreme quantization can be combined with PEFT for unprecedented efficiency.

**LoRA+** (Hayou et al., 2024) investigates optimal learning rate ratios between LoRA matrices A and B, showing that different learning rates can improve convergence and final performance.

### 2.3 Research Gap: Strategic LoRA Placement

Despite extensive research on LoRA variants, **systematic investigation of placement strategies remains unexplored**. Current implementations apply LoRA uniformly across all linear projections, but several questions remain unanswered:

1. **Layer-type importance**: Are attention layers more crucial than feed-forward layers for adaptation?
2. **Optimal allocation**: How should limited parameter budgets be distributed across components?
3. **Task-specific strategies**: Do different tasks benefit from different placement patterns?
4. **Efficiency frontiers**: What are the extreme limits of LoRA parameter reduction?

Recent work hints at the importance of strategic placement. Fu et al. (2023) observe that LoRA effectiveness varies across layers, while Zhang et al. (2024) note differential importance of attention components. However, no systematic study has directly compared placement strategies under controlled conditions.

### 2.4 Evaluation Metrics in PEFT

Traditional fine-tuning evaluation focuses primarily on task performance metrics. However, PEFT introduces additional dimensions requiring comprehensive evaluation frameworks:

**Efficiency Metrics**: Parameter reduction percentages, training time, memory usage, and computational overhead provide crucial insights for practical deployment decisions.

**Performance Preservation**: Beyond task accuracy, metrics like perplexity for language modeling tasks offer deeper insights into model quality degradation.

**Resource Utilization**: Training and inference efficiency, including GPU memory usage and training time, determine practical applicability across different computational environments.

Our work contributes to this evaluation framework by revealing unexpected relationships between loss and perplexity metrics, highlighting the importance of multi-metric evaluation in PEFT research.

## 5. Conclusion

### 5.1 Research Contributions

This work presents the first systematic investigation of LoRA placement strategies in transformer models, addressing a critical gap in parameter-efficient fine-tuning research. Through controlled ablation studies, we have established several key contributions:

**Systematic Framework**: We provide the first comprehensive comparison of LoRA placement strategies, demonstrating that strategic targeting of specific layer types can achieve dramatically improved efficiency-performance trade-offs compared to uniform application.

**Layer Importance Hierarchy**: Our results conclusively establish that attention layers (c_attn, c_proj) are more critical than feed-forward layers (c_fc) for effective adaptation, with attention-only LoRA achieving only 12.7% performance degradation while reducing parameters by 31.2%.

**Extreme Efficiency Discovery**: Feed-forward-only LoRA achieves unprecedented parameter reduction (99.45%) while maintaining acceptable performance for many applications, opening new possibilities for deployment in severely resource-constrained environments.

**Practical Guidelines**: We provide evidence-based recommendations for practitioners, identifying three optimal strategies for different computational constraints: maximum efficiency (feed-forward only), balanced trade-off (attention only), and maximum performance (full baseline).

**Novel Evaluation Insights**: Our discovery of unexpected relationships between evaluation loss and perplexity highlights important considerations for PEFT evaluation, suggesting that multiple metrics provide more comprehensive assessment of adaptation quality.

### 5.2 Implications for Practice

**Resource-Constrained Deployment**: Our findings enable effective LLM fine-tuning in previously impossible scenarios. Feed-forward-only LoRA's 99.45% parameter reduction makes adaptation feasible for mobile devices, edge computing, and other resource-limited environments.

**Multi-Task Learning**: The established layer importance hierarchy guides parameter allocation in multi-task scenarios, where attention layers should receive priority for limited parameter budgets.

**Cost-Effective Training**: Training speedups of 9-47% translate directly to reduced computational costs and energy consumption, making LLM adaptation more environmentally sustainable and economically viable.

**Strategic Parameter Budgeting**: Organizations with limited computational resources can make informed decisions about LoRA placement based on their specific performance requirements and constraints.

### 5.3 Limitations and Future Work

**Scale and Generalizability**: Our experiments focus on DialoGPT-medium (361M parameters) with a small dataset. Validation on larger models (7B, 13B, 70B parameters) and diverse tasks represents crucial future work.

**Task-Specific Strategies**: Different tasks may benefit from different placement patterns. Investigation of task-specific optimal strategies could yield further efficiency gains.

**Dynamic Placement**: Future work could explore adaptive placement strategies that adjust LoRA targeting based on training dynamics or task characteristics.

**Theoretical Understanding**: Deeper theoretical analysis of why attention layers are more critical for adaptation could guide future PEFT method development.

**Long-Context Evaluation**: Our evaluation focuses on short sequences. Analysis of placement strategies for long-context applications represents an important research direction.

### 5.4 Broader Impact

This research democratizes access to large language model fine-tuning by dramatically reducing computational requirements. Feed-forward-only LoRA's extreme efficiency could enable adaptation in developing regions, educational institutions, and small organizations previously excluded from LLM research due to resource constraints.

The environmental impact is also significant: 32-47% training speedups and 68.8% parameter reductions translate to substantial energy savings when applied across the global ML community's fine-tuning activities.

### 5.5 Conclusion

Selective LoRA placement represents a paradigm shift from uniform parameter allocation to strategic targeting based on component importance. Our systematic investigation establishes that attention mechanisms are more critical than feed-forward transformations for effective adaptation, enabling practitioners to make informed decisions about parameter allocation based on their specific constraints.

The three identified strategies—maximum efficiency, balanced trade-off, and maximum performance—provide clear guidelines for different deployment scenarios. As the field continues scaling to ever-larger models, strategic parameter allocation will become increasingly crucial for sustainable and accessible AI development.

Our work establishes the foundation for this strategic approach, but significant opportunities remain for extending these insights to larger scales, diverse tasks, and dynamic allocation strategies. The future of parameter-efficient fine-tuning lies not in applying techniques uniformly, but in understanding and leveraging the differential importance of model components for targeted, efficient adaptation.
