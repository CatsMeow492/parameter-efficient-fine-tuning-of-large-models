# Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Research Project

A research project investigating **selective LoRA placement strategies** for optimal efficiency-performance trade-offs in large language model fine-tuning.

## Research Question

> **"Can selective LoRA placement in specific transformer layers (attention-only, feed-forward-only, or strategic layer subsets) achieve comparable performance to full-model LoRA placement while using fewer trainable parameters?"**
