A Simple 10‑Step Roadmap to Your First Research Paper

(focused on parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning of large models, but the flow generalizes to most applied ML work)

#	What you do	Why it matters	Typical tools / tips
1. Define the micro‑question	Phrase a single, testable question: e.g., “Does placing LoRA adapters only in the feed‑forward blocks yield the same accuracy as the usual attention‑plus‑FF placement, with fewer trainable params?”	A crisp scope keeps the project small and publishable.	Draft a one‑paragraph problem statement in a doc.
2. Skim the closest prior work	Read ~5 key papers/blogs on LoRA, QLoRA, adapters. Capture gaps they leave open.	Ensures novelty; anchors evaluation setup.	Use Connected Papers / Elicit; keep notes in Notion or Obsidian.
3. Reproduce a baseline	Fine‑tune a public LLM (e.g., LLaMA‑2‑7B) with the standard adapter config on a small dataset (e.g., Alpaca, GSM8K).	Proves your pipeline works and yields a reference number.	Hugging Face PEFT + accelerate; Google Colab GPU is OK.
4. Implement your twist	Add the minimal code change that embodies your micro‑question (e.g., new adapter placement or size).	This is the contribution. Keep it small so experiments finish quickly.	Fork the PEFT repo or write a tiny wrapper; track commits.
5. Run controlled experiments	Train baseline vs. your method on identical data; log metrics (accuracy, perplexity, wall‑clock time, VRAM, #trainable params).	Solid comparisons are the heart of the results section.	Weights & Biases / MLflow for tracking; seed everything.
6. Analyze & visualize	Turn raw logs into simple plots/tables that answer the question: “Same accuracy? faster? lighter?”	Clear visuals make the story obvious.	pandas + matplotlib; save charts for the paper.
7. Draft the paper (iterative)	Write Introduction → Method → Experiments → Results → Limitations → Conclusion. Fill in as data arrives.	Writing early surfaces gaps while they’re still fixable.	Start in Overleaf (LaTeX) using a template from your target venue.
8. Collect friendly reviews	Share the PDF with 2–3 peers (colleagues, online ML community). Ask: “What’s unclear or unconvincing?”	Early feedback avoids harsh surprises from formal reviewers.	Google Docs comments or GitHub issues.
9. Pick a venue & polish	Choose a low‑barrier workshop, demo track, or arXiv + open‑review workshop (e.g., NeurIPS D&B, EMNLP Workshops). Adapt formatting and page limit.	Workshops and arXiv are newcomer‑friendly yet citable.	Follow the venue’s style file; double‑check reference format.
10. Submit, iterate, release code	Upload to arXiv (and/or conference submission site). Push repro code + README to GitHub.	Public code + preprint boosts credibility and future citations.	Create a GitHub tag; include an MIT or Apache‑2 license.
